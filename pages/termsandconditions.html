        <p>Purchases and Automatically Renewing Subscriptions
            You may have the opportunity to purchase products and services from WeSo. If you purchase

            until the end of your subscription period, at which point is will expire. Because our Services may

            membership as set forth in this Agreement.

            Copyright Act (the "DMCA"). If you believe any Customer Data or WeSo Content infringes
            upon your intellectual property rights, please submit a notification alleging such infringement
            ("DMCA Takedown Notice") as set forth at 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), including the following:
            A. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
            an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
            B. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple
            copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a
            representative list of such works;
            C. Identification of the material claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
            activity and that is to be removed or access disabled and information reasonably
            sufficient to permit WeSo, as the service provider, to locate the material;
            D. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an
            address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address;
            E. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in
            the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
            F. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of
            perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
            exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
            If you believe that any WeSo Content or anything on the Services infringes any copyright that
            you own or control, you may file a notice of such infringement with our designated agent by
            email at info@wesoapp.net.
            WeSo will strive to quickly remove any infringing material from our site. If WeSo becomes
            aware that one of its users is a repeat copyright infringer, it is our policy to take reasonable steps

            within our power to terminate the user's account. All customers should be aware of and comply
            with applicable copyright laws.</p>

            thereof), or use of the Services, and remove and discard any Customer Data within the Services,
            for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if WeSo believes that you have
            violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. WeSo may also in its sole
            discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or

            without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any

            WeSo shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the
            Services. If WeSo terminates your account for a violation of these Terms, misuse of our
            Services, or behaved in a way that WeSo regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off of our
            Services, then WeSo reserves the right to terminate without any refund to you.
            WeSo reserves the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal, or other means
            available to enforce the Terms, at any time without liability and without the obligation to give

            your account is terminated by you or by WeSo for any reason, these Terms continue and remain
            enforceable between you and WeSo, and you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases
            made. Your information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>16. Indemnification</h4>
        <p>By agreeing to these Terms and Conditions, you agree to indemnify WeSo if a claim is made
            against WeSo due to your actions. You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to
            indemnify, defend, and hold harmless WeSo, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers,
            directors, members, managers, parent companies, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, suppliers,
            agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages,
            losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, due to, arising out of, or relating
            in any way to (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b) any Customer Data you post, upload,
            use, distribute, store, or otherwise transmit through the Services; (c) your violation of these
            Terms and Conditions; (d) your violation of the rights of another, including without limitation,
            any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, privacy, or propriety right; or (e) your
            violation of any statutes, codes, ordinances, laws, rules, regulations, including without limitation,
            all regulatory, administrative, and legislative authorities.</p>
        <h4>17. Limitation of Liability</h4>
        <p>EXCEPT WHERE PROHIBITED BY LAW, AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
            BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WESO, ITS AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES,
            LICENSORS, OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
            CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, WHETHER INCURRED
            DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER
            INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR
            INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES, (B) THE PROVISION OF THE
            SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS AVAILABLE THEREIN; (C) THE CONDUCT OR
            CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON, THROUGH, OR FOLLOWING
            USE OF THE SERVICES; OR (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF
            YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF WESO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

            SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL WESO'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU
            FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID, IF
            ANY, BY YOU TO WESO FOR THE SERVICES. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
            PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES
            UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
            YOU ASSUME TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. YOUR
            ONLY REMEDY AGAINST WESO FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES OR
            ANY CONTENT, IS TO STOP USING THE SERVICES. IF, NOTWITHSTANDING THESE
            TERMS, WESO IS FOUND LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS THAT
            ARISES OUT OF OR IS IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH YOUR USE OF THE
            SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT, WESO'S LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED
            THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICES OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS, OR
            $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
            SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
            CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN
            THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>


        <h4>18. Arbitration Agreement; Class Waiver; Waiver of Trial by Jury.</h4>
        <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY
            REQUIRE YOU AND WESO TO AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES THROUGH
            BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
            Except where prohibited by law:
            A. The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to
            this Agreement, including in contract, tort or otherwise and including all statutory
            claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of WeSo
            Services that cannot be resolved in small claims court shall be resolved by BINDING
            ARBITRATION on an individual basis, except that you and WeSo are not required to
            arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged
            unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
            Specifically, the phrase &quot;all claims and disputes&quot; also includes claims and disputes
            that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms.or our Services.
            B. Either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-
            claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party
            may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party's claim is
            within the jurisdiction of the small claims court. If the responding party requests to
            proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration
            shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the
            arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration
            or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims
            court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any

            circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class
            arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
            C. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
            enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through
            the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and will be governed by the AAA
            Consumer Arbitration Rules, available here as of the date of these Terms, or by
            visiting the AAA web site at https://www.adr.org. If the AAA is not available to
            arbitrate, the parties will select a mutually agreed upon alternative arbitral forum. The
            rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the
            extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a
            single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes may be resolved through binding
            non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the arbitrator. Any judgment on the
            award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
            jurisdiction.
            D. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by
            telephone, online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific
            manner will be chosen by the arbitrator. The arbitration will not involve any personal
            appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
            E. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and
            liabilities, if any, of you and WeSo. The dispute will not be consolidated with any
            other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the
            authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The
            arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-
            monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum's
            rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of
            decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
            based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
            authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
            have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and WeSo.
            F. By using our Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In
            doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any
            claims between you and WeSo (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims
            court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
            ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a
            NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall
            determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair
            hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but
            you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined
            than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable
            in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details
            on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.
            G. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to
            confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of

            competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason
            held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims
            court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in
            Broward County, Florida. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those
            courts for such purposes.

            Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND WESO WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
            STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE
            OR A JURY. You and WeSo are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by
            arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than
            rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation
            between you and WeSo over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND
            WESO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be
            resolved by a judge.
            Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE
            SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
            ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN
            ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
            CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this
            waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we
            are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth
            herein.
            Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this arbitration agreement may be waived
            by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other
            portion of this arbitration agreement.
            This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with WeSo
        </p>

        <h4>19. Exclusive Venue</h4>
        <p>To the extent that these Terms allow you or WeSo to initiate litigation in a court, both you and
            WeSo agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory
            claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Services will be
            litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. If,
            however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all such claims and
            disputes will be litigated exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction in Broward County,
            Florida. You and WeSo consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p>

        <h4>20. Choice of Law</h4>

        <p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of Florida, other than its
            conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract,
            tort, or otherwise) arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.</p>

        <h4>21. Severability</h4>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from
            these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

        <h4>22. Additional Terms</h4>
        <p>These Terms supersede all prior understandings regarding the same and represent the complete
            agreement between you and WeSo.
            These Terms do no create or confer any third-party beneficiary rights.
            WeSo may change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make
            changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an E-mail
            notification, posting a notice on the Services, or updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date above.
            WeSo reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
            You may not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without WeSo's
            consent.
            Your continued use of the Services will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms.
            We encourage you to frequently review the Terms to ensure you understand the terms and
            conditions that apply to your use of the Services.
            If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services and delete your
            WeSo account.

        <h1>WESOAPP.NET PRIVACY POLICY</h1>


        <p>At WeSo App, LLC (also referred to as "Company," "us," "our" or "we"), we appreciate that you, as our customer,
            trust us with your information, and we intend to keep your trust. This Privacy Policy discloses the WeSo privacy
            practices for our website and for any WeSo content (collectively, the "Site"), as well as related products and
            services we may offer to you (collectively referred to as the "Services"). This Policy also covers how personal
            and other information that we receive or collect about you is treated.
        </p>
        <p>Please read the information below carefully. You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is designed to be read in
            connection with the Site Terms of Service, which are available at https://wesoapp.net , and that by accessing or
            using our App, you agree to be bound by the App's Terms of Service, as well as this Policy.
            We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant
            changes in the way we treat personal information by placing a notice on our site and by updating any privacy
            information on this page. You will be notified by email also. Your continued use of the App or Services
            available through this App after any such modifications shall constitute your: (a) acknowledgment of the
            modified Policy; and (b) your agreement to abide and be bound by that modified Policy.
            If you have any questions about this Policy, please feel free to contact us at: https://wesoapp.net/contact.</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: BY USING THE APP OR THE OFFERINGS AVAILABLE ON THIS APP, YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL DATA
            THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
            TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE APP.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Types of Information We Collect</h4>
        <p>WeSo collects two main types of information about our customers: Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and
            Aggregate Information.
            Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that identifies specifics about you. When you engage
            in certain activities on this App, such as registering for an account, submitting content, or posting content on
            the App, or sending us feedback, WeSo may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. Examples of PII
            may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address, live location, telephone number,
            photographs or other images, and other identifying information. When purchasing products or services on the App,
            you may be asked to provide a credit card number.
            Aggregate Information refers to information that does not by itself identify you or any specific individual.
            WeSo also gathers certain information about you based upon where you visit on our App and what other sites may
            have directed you to us. This information is collected in a variety of different ways, and is compiled and
            analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Site's uniform resource
            locator ("URL") that points to the site you came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, details
            about the web browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.
        </p>
        <h4>2. How We Use Information</h4>
        <p>The main reason WeSo uses your information is to deliver and improve our services. Additionally, we use your
            info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.
            Some other practical examples of how we use your information are: (1) to administer your account and provide our
            services to you, (2) to help you connect with other users, (3) to improve our services and develop new ones with
            our customer's needs in mind, (4) to prevent, detect and address fraud, misbehavior or other illegal or
            unauthorized activities, and (5) to ensure legal compliance.
            We will primarily use your PII to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of
            PII to enhance the operation of our App, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze
            App use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our App's content, layout, and services. We
            pay use PII to engage in remarketing, both using our internal systems or with third-party service providers. We
            may use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use
            your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you, including our App
            Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h4>3. Information We Collect</h4>
        <p>We do not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to
            provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain products or services available on the App. These may
            include: (a) registering for an account on our App; (b) sending us an email message; (c) submitting a form or
            transmitting other information by telephone or letter; or (d) submitting your credit card or other payment
            information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our App. When processing certain information,
            such as payment information with affiliated banking institutions or payment processors, we encrypt the
            transaction, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, in order to prevent your PII from being
            stolen or intercepted. Additionally, your credit card information is never stored on our servers.
            WeSo may also collect, and/or our third-party advertising partners may collect, certain Aggregate Information.
            For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our App
            and to gather demographic information. Our third-party advertising partners may also provide us with aggregate
            and individual reports.
            We also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information
            from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account. For example, we use
            information you give us directly, and we receive information about you from others, including: other users,
            social media (you may be able to use your social media account (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into
            your WeSo account, which saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to
            share some information from your social media account with us), and other partners.
    
            WeSo also collects information when you use our services, for example about which features you've used, how
            you've used them and the devices you use to access our services (e.g., date and time you logged in, features
            you've been using, searches or search parameters, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring
            webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect
            and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive), information about
            the device(s) you use to access our services including hardware and software information such as IP address,
            device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as
            Google's AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into
            your device' settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated
            with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC
            address); and information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal
            strength.
    
            WeSo collects other information with your consent. If you give us permission, we will be able to collect your
            precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) in order to offer you features that make use of it. Such
            geolocation is collected through various means, depending on the service and device you're using, including GPS,
            Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not
            collect it. Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to
            publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).
        </p>
        <h4>4. Cookies</h4>
        <p>We use and may allow other third-parties to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to
            recognize you and/or your device(s). A cookie is a small data-text file which is stored on your device that
            uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your IP
            address, browser type, the server your device is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your
            server, and your first name to welcome you back to our App.
            WeSo uses cookies, for example, for authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing App
            traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use
            social features, monitoring aggregate App usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords, storing account
            and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we make available to you.
            You can control the use of Cookies through your browser settings and other tools. Most browsers are initially
            set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is
            being sent. However, if you elect to disable cookies, some aspects of the App may not function properly.
            Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome etc) have a "Do Not Track" ("DNT")
            feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website
            that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain
            information about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform,
            and so WeSo does not currently respond to DNT signals.
            Third-parties, such as advertisers, as part of their service, will place a separate cookie on your device. WeSo,
            and our third-party server may collect and use Aggregate Information about you, such as your IP address, browser
            type, the server your device is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether
            you responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our App in the same manner as
            above.
        </p>
        <h4>5. Release of Information</h4>
        <p>We will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others, except as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We provide some
            of our product and service offerings through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers,
            partners, and other third parties ("Service Partners"). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in
            order to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to you. For example, we
            must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services
            purchased on this App; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you
            ordered; release your PII to detect and prevent fraudulent activity and transactions; and provide order
            information to third parties that help us provide customer service.
            We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However, the use of your
            PII by our Service Partners is not subject to our control. Each Service Partner is governed by their own
            respective terms of service and privacy policies. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this
            document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites accessible
            through this App, including our Advertising and Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data
            collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site's terms of service and privacy policy. We
            are not responsible for the policies or practices of any third-parties.
            Law enforcement or judicial authorities may require us to provide PII to the appropriate governmental
            authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a
            law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our
            services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that
            we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
            We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related App
            information to third-party Service Partners.
        </p>
        <h4>6. Updating, Correcting, or Deleting Information</h4>
        <p>You may change any of your PII in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with
            instructions posted elsewhere on this App. You may also access and correct your personal information and privacy
            preferences by emailing us at:
            Email: support@wesoapp.net
            Please include your first and last name, profile name, and account email address when you contact us.
            We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes.
            You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past
            transactions, logs of technical support calls, or other transactional information may not be deleted. In
            addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because
            of backups.
        </p>
        <h4>7. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h4>
        <p>WeSo may, from time to time, send you an email and send App messages regarding new products and services that we
            feel may interest you. Only we (or agents working on behalf of us and under confidentiality agreements) will
            send you these solicitations. If you do not want to receive solicitations emails from WeSo, you can "opt-out" by
            accessing the unsubscribe link in the bottom of the email received.
            You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described above. By modifying your browser preferences, you
            have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you
            choose to reject all cookies some parts of our App may not work properly in your case.</p>
        <h4>8. Security of Your PII</h4>
        <p>At our App you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We strive to
            take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
            disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:
            We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete, and current. We may keep
            collected information indefinitely and use it pursuant to the App's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy or to
            comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
            We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors, and agents who have a reasonable need to come
            into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with
            limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the App.
            Additionally, we also employ a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our
            secure servers are protected by industry-standard encryption, and our servers reside behind firewalls and use
            high-level password protection.
            Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This
            password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
            In order to most effectively serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by
            established third-party banking institutions and processing agents. They receive the information needed to
            verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
            Be advised that no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100%
            secure. As a result, while WeSo strives to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and
            privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and
            privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this App cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <h4>9. Children's Privacy</h4>
        <p>OUR SERVICES ARE RESTRICTED TO USERS WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. We do not permit users under the age of
            18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If you
            suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.
            10. Miscellaneous
            You must be an individual who is at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this App. Our policy is
            that we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII about minor visitors.
            You should also be aware that when you disclose Personally Identifiable Information (i.e. your name, email
            address, etc.) in the public areas on this App, that information, along with any information disclosed in your
            communication, can be collected and used by third- parties and may result in unsolicited messages (including
            unwanted spam messages) from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not
            apply to such information. Please consult our App Terms and Conditions at https://wesoapp.net. In the event of a
            conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions, the Terms and Conditions are controlling.
            If you have any questions, concerns, or inquiries about our Privacy Policy, our use of your PII, or our privacy
            practices, please contact us at support@wesoapp.net.
            You can also reach our Privacy Compliance Officer by sending written correspondence to:
            support@wesoapp.net</p>
