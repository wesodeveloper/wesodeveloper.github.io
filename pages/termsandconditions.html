Information We Collect</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>WeSo collects two
main types of information about our customers: Personally Identifiable
Information (&quot;PII&quot;) and Aggregate Information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Personally
Identifiable Information refers to information that identifies specifics about
you. When you engage in certain activities on this App, such as registering for
an account, submitting content, or posting content on the App, or sending us
feedback, WeSo may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. 
Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address, mailing
address, live location, telephone number, photographs or other images, and
other identifying information. When purchasing products or services on the App,
you may be asked to provide a credit card number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Aggregate
Information refers to information that does not by itself identify you or any
specific individual. WeSo also gathers certain information about you based upon
where you visit on our App and what other sites may have directed you to us.
This information is collected in a variety of different ways, and is compiled
and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may
include the Site's uniform resource locator (&quot;URL&quot;) that points to
the site you came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, details
about the web browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol
(&quot;IP&quot;) address.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span

Information</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The main reason
WeSo uses your information is to deliver and improve our services.
Additionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with
advertising that may be of interest to you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Some other
practical examples of how we use your information are: (1) to administer your
account and provide our services to you, (2) to help you connect with other
users, (3) to improve our services and develop new ones with our customer’s
needs in mind, (4) to prevent, detect and address fraud, misbehavior or other
illegal or unauthorized activities, and (5) to ensure legal compliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We will primarily
use your PII to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also use
certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our App, improve our marketing
and promotional efforts, statistically analyze App use, improve our product and
service offerings, and customize our App's content, layout, and services. We
pay use PII to engage in remarketing, both using our internal systems or with
third-party service providers. We may use PII to deliver information to you and
to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use your PII to
resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you,
including our App Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>3.  Information We
Collect</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We do not collect
any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be
required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain products or
services available on the App. These may include: (a) registering for an
account on our App; (b) sending us an email message; (c) submitting a form or
transmitting other information by telephone or letter; or (d) submitting your
credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products
and services on our App. When processing certain information, such as payment
information with affiliated banking institutions or payment processors, we
encrypt the transaction, using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology,
in order to prevent your PII from being stolen or intercepted. Additionally,
your credit card information is never stored on our servers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>WeSo may also
collect, and/or our third-party advertising partners may collect, certain
Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose
problems with our servers, software, to administer our App and to gather
demographic information. Our third-party advertising partners may also provide
us with aggregate and individual reports.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>We also collect
information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well
as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a
social media account. For example, we use information you give us directly, and
we receive information about you from others, including: other users, social
media (you may be able to use your social media account (such as Facebook
Login) to create and log into your WeSo account, which saves you from having to
remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some
information from your social media account with us), and other partners.</span></p>

allow other third-parties to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web

data-text file which is stored on your device that uniquely identifies your
browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your
IP address, browser type, the server your device is logged onto, the area code
and zip code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you
back to our App. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span

analyzing App traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:7.8pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Some web browsers
(including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome etc) have a “Do Not

his or her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal
receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting
certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT
option and DNT signals are not yet uniform, and so WeSo does not currently
respond to DNT signals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Third-parties,

your device. WeSo, and our third-party server may collect and use Aggregate
Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your
device is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server
and whether you responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place
banner ads on our App in the same manner as above.</span></p>

services purchased on this App; release your address information to the
delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; release your PII to
detect and prevent fraudulent activity and transactions; and provide order
